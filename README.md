# AudicaFollowCamera
 A camera that acts similarly to LIV's third person camera

Must set camera to static 3rd person.

The mod will do the switch once you're back to the main menu currently, this will change in a future update.

So to activate and change the settings using the menu you have to set static 3rd person cam, go back to the main menu and then go back to spectator cam settings. If 3rd person static was already set you don't need to do that. The settings are in the spectator cam menu below Twitch chat, and they are saved in a configuration file.
