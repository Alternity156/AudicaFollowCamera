# AudicaFollowCamera
 A camera that acts similarly to LIV's third person camera

Must set camera to static 3rd person.

Settings are in the spectator cam settings menu.

## Known bugs

Have to toggle spectator camera to another mode and come back to 3rd person static once to fix FOV in the preview window, this bug does not affect the actual game window, only the one in VR in that menu.

Will crash if the spectator camera is set to first person at launch and go in the settings menu for some reason. Removing the patch to the Update function of the spectator camera prevents the bug somehow, no idea why this happens as for now.
