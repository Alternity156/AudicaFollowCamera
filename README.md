# AudicaFollowCamera
 A camera that acts similarly to LIV's third person camera

Must set camera to static 3rd person.

Settings are in the spectator cam settings menu.

## Known bugs

Have to toggle spectator camera to another mode and come back to 3rd person static once to fix FOV in the preview window, this bug does not affect the actual game window, only the one in VR in that menu.
